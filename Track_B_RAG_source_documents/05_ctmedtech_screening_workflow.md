# CTMEDTECH Retinal Screening Workflow (Sample Internal Document)

This document describes the sample AI-assisted retinal screening workflow used at a
CTMEDTECH partner clinic. It is provided as reference material for this assessment.

When a patient arrives for screening, a technician captures colour fundus photographs
of both eyes using a standard fundus camera. The images are uploaded to the CTMEDTECH
screening platform, which runs an AI analysis to detect signs of two conditions:
diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.

For each eye, the platform produces a risk level of Low, Medium, or High, together
with a heatmap highlighting the regions that influenced the result. All Medium and
High results are queued for review by an ophthalmologist, who confirms or overrides
the AI assessment. The platform's service-level target is that flagged images are
reviewed by a clinician within 24 hours.

Patients with a Low result are advised to return for routine screening in 12 months.
Patients confirmed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or with suspected wet AMD
are referred to a specialist for treatment and are contacted by the clinic within
48 hours to schedule an appointment. The platform stores each image, its risk level,
and the reviewing clinician's decision in the patient record for audit and follow-up.
