"""
5-question evaluation for the CTMEDTECH RAG system.

Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to be set.
Run with: python -m src.tests.eval

Questions:
  Q1 — answerable, single document (glaucoma)
  Q2 — answerable, single document (diabetic retinopathy)
  Q3 — answerable, CROSS-DOCUMENT (platform workflow + disease docs)
  Q4 — must refuse (surgery success rate not in docs)
  Q5 — must refuse (completely out of scope)

# refuse_kind:

#   "in_scope_no_answer" — relevant docs are retrieved but lack the specific fact;
#                          only the Anthropic (LLM) backend can refuse here, so the
