"""Anthropic-powered answer generation with mandatory citation and refusal.

Production hardening:
- The Anthropic client is configured with automatic retries and a request
  timeout (exponential backoff on 429/5xx/connection errors is handled by the
  SDK), so transient failures don't surface to the user.
- A final, non-recoverable API failure is wrapped in `GenerationError` with a
  clean message instead of leaking a raw stack trace to callers (CLI / API).
- Section metadata from the retriever is passed into the context to help the
  model locate the relevant passage, while the citation format stays exactly
  `[Source: <filename>]` so refusals remain programmatically detectable.
